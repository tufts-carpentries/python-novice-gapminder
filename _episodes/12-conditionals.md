## Use `if` statements to control whether or not a block of code is executed.

*   An `if` statement (more properly called a *conditional* statement)
    controls whether some block of code is executed or not.
*   Structure is similar to a `for` statement:
    *   First line opens with `if` and ends with a colon
    *   Body containing one or more statements is indented (usually by 4 spaces)

~~~
mass = 3.54
if mass > 3.0:
    print(mass, 'is large')

mass = 2.07
if mass > 3.0:
    print (mass, 'is large')
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
3.54 is large
~~~
{: .output}

## Conditionals are often used inside loops.

*   Not much point using a conditional when we know the value (as above).
*   But useful when we have a collection to process.

~~~
masses = [3.54, 2.07, 9.22, 1.86, 1.71]
for m in masses:
    if m > 3.0:
        print(m, 'is large')
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
3.54 is large
9.22 is large
~~~
{: .output}

## Use `else` to execute a block of code when an `if` condition is *not* true.

*   `else` can be used following an `if`.
*   Allows us to specify an alternative to execute when the `if` *branch* isn't taken.

~~~
masses = [3.54, 2.07, 9.22, 1.86, 1.71]
for m in masses:
    if m > 3.0:
        print(m, 'is large')
    else:
        print(m, 'is small')
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
3.54 is large
2.07 is small
9.22 is large
1.86 is small
1.71 is small
~~~
{: .output}

## Use `elif` to specify additional tests.

*   May want to provide several alternative choices, each with its own test.
*   Use `elif` (short for "else if") and a condition to specify these.
*   Always associated with an `if`.
*   Must come before the `else` (which is the "catch all").

~~~
masses = [3.54, 2.07, 9.22, 1.86, 1.71]
for m in masses:
    if m > 9.0:
        print(m, 'is HUGE')
    elif m > 3.0:
        print(m, 'is large')
    else:
        print(m, 'is small')
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
3.54 is large
2.07 is small
9.22 is HUGE
1.86 is small
1.71 is small
~~~
{: .output}

## Conditions are tested once, in order.

*   Python steps through the branches of the conditional in order, testing each in turn.
*   So ordering matters.

~~~
grade = 85
if grade >= 70:
    print('grade is C')
elif grade >= 80:
    print('grade is B')
elif grade >= 90:
    print('grade is A')
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
grade is C
~~~
{: .output}

*   Does *not* automatically go back and re-evaluate if values change.

~~~
velocity = 10.0
if velocity > 20.0:
    print('moving too fast')
else:
    print('adjusting velocity')
    velocity = 50.0
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
adjusting velocity
~~~
{: .output}

*   Often use conditionals in a loop to "evolve" the values of variables.

~~~
velocity = 10.0
for i in range(5): # execute the loop 5 times
    print(i, ':', velocity)
    if velocity > 20.0:
        print('moving too fast')
        velocity = velocity - 5.0
    else:
        print('moving too slow')
        velocity = velocity + 10.0
print('final velocity:', velocity)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
0 : 10.0
moving too slow
1 : 20.0
moving too slow
2 : 30.0
moving too fast
3 : 25.0
moving too fast
4 : 20.0
moving too slow
final velocity: 30.0
~~~
{: .output}

*   The program must have a `print` statement *outside* the body of the loop
    to show the final value of `velocity`,
    since its value is updated by the last iteration of the loop.
